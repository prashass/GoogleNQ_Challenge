search `` Shortwave \\'\\' redirects here . For other uses , see Shortwave ( disambiguation ) . Grundig Satellit 400 solid - state , digital shortwave receiver , circa 1986 <P> Shortwave radio is radio transmission using shortwave radio frequencies . There is no official definition of the band , but the range always includes all of the high frequency band ( HF ) , and generally extends from 1.7 -- 30 MHz ( 176.3 -- 10.0 m ) ; from the high end of the medium frequency band ( MF ) just above the mediumwave AM broadcast band , to the end of the HF band . </P> <P> Radio waves in the shortwave band can be reflected or refracted from a layer of electrically charged atoms in the atmosphere called the ionosphere . Therefore , short waves directed at an angle into the sky can be reflected back to Earth at great distances , beyond the horizon . This is called skywave or `` skip \\'\\' propagation . Thus shortwave radio can be used for very long distance communication , in contrast to radio waves of higher frequency which travel in straight lines ( line - of - sight propagation ) and are limited by the visual horizon , about 40 miles ( 64 km ) . Shortwave radio is used for broadcasting of voice and music to shortwave listeners over very large areas ; sometimes entire continents or beyond . It is also used for military over-the - horizon radar , diplomatic communication , and two - way international communication by amateur radio enthusiasts for hobby , educational and emergency purposes , as well as for long distance aviation and marine communications . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Frequency classifications </Li> <Li> 2 History <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Development </Li> <Li> 2.2 Amateur use of shortwave propagation </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Propagation characteristics </Li> <Li> 4 Types of modulation </Li> <Li> 5 Users </Li> <Li> 6 Shortwave broadcasting <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Frequency allocations </Li> <Li> 6.2 Advantages </Li> <Li> 6.3 Disadvantages </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Shortwave listening </Li> <Li> 8 Shortwave broadcasts and music </Li> <Li> 9 Shortwave \\'s future </Li> <Li> 10 See also </Li> <Li> 11 References </Li> <Li> 12 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Frequency classifications ( edit ) </H2> <P> The widest popular definition of the shortwave frequency interval is the ITU Region 1 ( EU + Africa + Russia ... ) definition , and is the span 1.6 -- 30 MHz , just above the medium wave band , which ends approximately at 1.6 MHz . </P> <P> There are also other definitions of the shortwave frequency interval : </P> <Ul> <Li> 1.71 to 30 MHz in ITU Region 2 ( North and South America ... ) </Li> <Li> 1.8 ( 160 meter radio amateur band start ) to 30 MHz </Li> <Li> 2.3 ( 120 meter band start ) to 30 MHz </Li> <Li> 2.3 ( 120 meter band start ) to 26.1 MHz ( 11 meter band end ) </Li> <Li> In Germany and perhaps Austria the ITU Region 1 shortwave radio frequency interval can be subdivided in : <Ul> <Li> de : Grenzwelle ( `` border waves \\'\\' ) : 1.605 -- 3.8 MHz </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> In Germany these shortwave radio frequency intervals have also been seen used : <Ul> <Li> the above other definitions </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Development ( edit ) </H3> Radio amateurs carried out the first shortwave transmissions over a long distance before Guglielmo Marconi <P> The name `` shortwave \\'\\' originated during the early days of radio in the early 20th century , when the radio spectrum was considered divided into long wave ( LW ) , medium wave ( MW ) and short wave bands based on the wavelength of the radio waves . Shortwave radio received its name because the wavelengths in this band are relatively shorter than 200 m ( 1,500 kHz ) which marked the original upper limit of the medium frequency band first used for radio communications . The broadcast medium wave band now extends above the 200 m / 1,500 kHz limit , and the amateur radio 1.8 MHz -- 2.0 MHz band ( known as the `` top band \\'\\' ) is the lowest - frequency band considered to be \\' shortwave \\' . </P> <P> Early long distance radio telegraphy used long waves , below 300 kilohertz ( kHz ) . The drawbacks to this system included a very limited spectrum available for long distance communication , and the very expensive transmitters , receivers and gigantic antennas that were required . It was also difficult to beam the radio wave directionally with long wave , resulting in a major loss of power over long distances . Prior to the 1920s , the shortwave frequencies above 1.5 MHz were regarded as useless for long distance communication and were designated in many countries for amateur use . </P> <P> Guglielmo Marconi , pioneer of radio , commissioned his assistant Charles Samuel Franklin to carry out a large scale study into the transmission characteristics of short wavelength waves and to determine their suitability for long distance transmissions . Franklin rigged up a large antenna at Poldhu Wireless Station , Cornwall , running on 25 kW of power . In June and July 1923 , wireless transmissions were completed during nights on 97 meters from Poldhu to Marconi \\'s yacht Elettra in the Cape Verde Islands . </P> <P> In September 1924 , Marconi transmitted daytime and nighttime on 32 meters from Poldhu to his yacht in Beirut . Franklin went on to refine the directional transmission , by inventing the curtain array aerial system . In July 1924 , Marconi entered into contracts with the British General Post Office ( GPO ) to install high speed shortwave telegraphy circuits from London to Australia , India , South Africa and Canada as the main element of the Imperial Wireless Chain . The UK - to - Canada shortwave `` Beam Wireless Service \\'\\' went into commercial operation on 25 October 1926 . Beam Wireless Services from the UK to Australia , South Africa and India went into service in 1927 . </P> <P> Shortwave communications began to grow rapidly in the 1920s , similar to the internet in the late 20th century . By 1928 , more than half of long distance communications had moved from transoceanic cables and longwave wireless services to shortwave and the overall volume of transoceanic shortwave communications had vastly increased . Shortwave stations had cost and efficiency advantages over massive longwave wireless installations , however some commercial longwave communications stations remained in use until the 1960s . Long distance radio circuits also reduced the load on the existing transoceanic telegraph cables and hence the need for new cables , although the cables maintained their advantages of high security and a much more reliable and better quality signal than shortwave . </P> <P> The cable companies began to lose large sums of money in 1927 , and a serious financial crisis threatened the viability of cable companies that were vital to strategic British interests . The British government convened the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference in 1928 `` to examine the situation that had arisen as a result of the competition of Beam Wireless with the Cable Services \\'\\' . It recommended and received Government approval for all overseas cable and wireless resources of the Empire to be merged into one system controlled by a newly formed company in 1929 , Imperial and International Communications Ltd . The name of the company was changed to Cable and Wireless Ltd. in 1934 . </P> <P> Long - distance cables had a resurgence beginning in 1956 with the laying of TAT - 1 across the Atlantic Ocean , the first voice frequency cable on this route . This provided 36 high quality telephone channels and was soon followed by even higher capacity cables all around the world . These sounded the death knell of shortwave radio for commercial communications . </P> <H3> Amateur use of shortwave propagation ( edit ) </H3> Hallicrafters SX - 28 shortwave receiver analog tuning dial , circa 1944 <P> Amateur radio operators also discovered that long - distance communication was possible on shortwave bands . Early long - distance services used surface wave propagation at very low frequencies , which are attenuated along the path at wavelengths shorter than 1,000 meters . Longer distances and higher frequencies using this method meant more signal loss . This , and the difficulties of generating and detecting higher frequencies , made discovery of shortwave propagation difficult for commercial services . </P> <P> Radio amateurs may have conducted the first successful transatlantic tests in December 1921 , operating in the 200 meter mediumwave band ( near 1,500 kHz in the modern AM broadcast band ) -- the shortest wavelength then available to amateurs . In 1922 hundreds of North American amateurs were heard in Europe on 200 meters and at least 20 North American amateurs heard amateur signals from Europe . The first two - way communications between North American and Hawaiian amateurs began in 1922 at 200 meters . Although operation on wavelengths shorter than 200 meters was technically illegal ( but tolerated as the authorities mistakenly believed at first that such frequencies were useless for commercial or military use ) , amateurs began to experiment with those wavelengths using newly available vacuum tubes shortly after World War I . </P> <P> Extreme interference at the longer edge of the 150 -- 200 meter band -- the official wavelengths allocated to amateurs by the Second National Radio Conference in 1923 -- forced amateurs to shift to shorter and shorter wavelengths ; however , amateurs were limited by regulation to wavelengths longer than 150 meters ( 2 MHz ) . A few fortunate amateurs who obtained special permission for experimental communications at wavelengths shorter than 150 meters completed hundreds of long distance two way contacts on 100 meters ( 3 MHz ) in 1923 including the first transatlantic two way contacts . </P> <P> By 1924 many additional specially licensed amateurs were routinely making transoceanic contacts at distances of 6,000 miles ( 9,600 km ) and more . On 21 September 1924 several amateurs in California completed two - way contacts with an amateur in New Zealand . On 19 October amateurs in New Zealand and England completed a 90 minute two - way contact nearly halfway around the world . On 10 October the Third National Radio Conference made three shortwave bands available to U.S. amateurs at 80 meters ( 3.75 MHz ) , 40 meters ( 7 MHz ) and 20 meters ( 14 MHz ) . These were allocated worldwide , while the 10 meter band ( 28 MHz ) was created by the Washington International Radiotelegraph Conference on 25 November 1927 . The 15 meter band ( 21 MHz ) was opened to amateurs in the United States on 1 May 1952 . </P> <H2> Propagation characteristics ( edit ) </H2> Formation of a skip zone <P> Shortwave radio frequency energy is capable of reaching any location on the Earth as it is influenced by ionospheric reflection back to the earth by the ionosphere , ( a phenomenon known as `` skywave propagation \\'\\' ) . A typical phenomenon of shortwave propagation is the occurrence of a skip zone where reception fails . With a fixed working frequency , large changes in ionospheric conditions may create skip zones at night . </P> <P> As a result of the multi-layer structure of the ionosphere , propagation often simultaneously occurs on different paths , scattered by the E or F region and with different numbers of hops , a phenomenon that may be disturbed for certain techniques . Particularly for lower frequencies of the shortwave band , absorption of radio frequency energy in the lowest ionospheric layer , the D layer , may impose a serious limit . This is due to collisions of electrons with neutral molecules , absorbing some of a radio frequency \\'s energy and converting it to heat . Predictions of skywave propagation depend on : </P> <Ul> <Li> The distance from the transmitter to the target receiver . </Li> <Li> Time of day . During the day , frequencies higher than approximately 12 MHz can travel longer distances than lower ones . At night , this property is reversed . </Li> <Li> With lower frequencies the dependence on the time of the day is mainly due to the lowest ionospheric layer , the D Layer , forming only during the day when photons from the sun break up atoms into ions and free electrons . </Li> <Li> Season . During the winter months of the Northern or Southern hemispheres , the AM / MW broadcast band tends to be more favorable because of longer hours of darkness . </Li> <Li> Solar flares produce a large increase in D region ionization so high , sometimes for periods of several minutes , all skywave propagation is nonexistent . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Types of modulation ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Modulation National Panasonic R3000 analog shortwave receiver , circa 1965 <P> Several different types of modulation are used to impress information on a short - wave transmission . </P> <P> Amplitude modulation is the simplest type and the most commonly used for shortwave broadcasting . The instantaneous amplitude of the carrier is controlled by the amplitude of the signal ( speech , or music , for example ) . At the receiver , a simple detector recovers the desired modulation signal from the carrier . </P> <P> Single sideband transmission is a form of amplitude modulation but in effect filters the result of modulation . An amplitude - modulated signal has frequency components both above and below the carrier frequency . If one set of these components is eliminated as well as the residual carrier , only the remaining set is transmitted . This reduces power in the transmission , as roughly 2 / 3 of the energy sent by an AM signal is unnecessary to recover the information contained on it . It also reduces `` bandwidth \\'\\' , enabling about one - half the carrier frequency spectrum width to be used . The drawback is the receiver is more complicated , since it must re-create the carrier to recover the signal . Small errors in the detection process greatly affect the pitch of the received signal . As a result , single sideband is not used for music or general broadcast . Single sideband is used for long - range voice communications by ships and aircraft , Citizen \\'s Band , and amateur radio operators . Lower sideband ( LSB ) is generally used below 9 MHz and USB ( upper sideband ) above 9 MHz . </P> <P> Vestigal sideband transmits the carrier and one complete sideband , but filters out the other sideband . It is a compromise between AM and SSB , enabing simple receivers to be used , but requires almost as much transmitter power as AM . One advantage is only half the bandwidth of an AM signal is used . It can be heard in the transmission of certain radio time signal stations . Vestigial sideband is used for over the air Television Broadcasts both analog and digital . </P> <P> Continuous wave ( CW ) is on - and - off keying of a carrier , used for Morse code communications and Hellschreiber facsimile - based teleprinter transmissions . </P> <P> Narrow - band frequency modulation ( NBFM ) is used typically above 20 MHz . Because of the larger bandwidth required , NBFM is commonly used for VHF communication . Regulations limit the bandwidth of a signal transmitted in the HF bands , and the advantages of frequency modulation are greatest if the FM signal has a wide bandwidth . NBFM is limited to short - range transmissions due to the multiphasic distortions created by the ionosphere . </P> <P> Digital Radio Mondiale ( DRM ) is a digital modulation for use on bands below 30 MHz . </P> <P> Radioteletype , fax , digital , slow - scan television and other systems use forms of frequency - shift keying or audio subcarriers on a shortwave carrier . These generally require special equipment to decode , such as software on a computer equipped with a sound card . </P> <H2> Users ( edit ) </H2> Portable shortwave receiver \\'s digital display tuned to the 75 meter band <P> Some established users of the shortwave radio bands may include : </P> <Ul> <Li> International broadcasting primarily by government - sponsored propaganda , international news ( for example , the BBC World Service ) or cultural stations to foreign audiences : the most common use of all . </Li> <Li> Domestic broadcasting : to widely dispersed populations with few longwave , mediumwave and FM stations serving them ; or for specialty political , religious and alternative media networks ; or of individual commercial and non-commercial paid broadcasts . </Li> <Li> Oceanic air traffic control uses the HF / shortwave band for long distance communication to aircraft over the oceans and poles , which are far beyond the range of traditional VHF frequencies . Modern systems also include satellite communications , such as ADS - C / CPDLC </Li> <Li> `` Utility \\'\\' stations transmitting messages not intended for the general public , such as merchant shipping , marine weather , and ship - to - shore stations ; for aviation weather and air - to - ground communications ; for military communications ; for long - distance governmental purposes , and for other non-broadcast communications . </Li> <Li> Amateur radio operators at the 80 / 75 , 60 , 40 , 30 , 20 , 17 , 15 , 12 , and 10 - meter bands . Licenses are granted by authorized government agencies . </Li> <Li> Time signal and radio clock stations : In North America , WWV radio and WWVH radio transmit at these frequencies : 2.5 MHz , 5 MHz , 10 MHz , and 15 MHz ; and WWV also transmits on 20 MHz . The CHU radio station in Canada transmits on the following frequencies : 3.33 MHz , 7.85 MHz , and 14.67 MHz . Other similar radio clock stations transmit on various shortwave and longwave frequencies around the world . The shortwave transmissions are primarily intended for human reception , while the longwave stations are generally used for automatic synchronization of watches and clocks . </Li> </Ul> <P> Sporadic or non-traditional users of the shortwave bands may include : </P> <Ul> <Li> Clandestine stations . These are stations that broadcast on behalf of various political movements such as rebel or insurrectionist forces . They may advocate civil war , insurrection , rebellion against the government - in - charge of the country to which they are directed . Clandestine broadcasts may emanate from transmitters located in rebel - controlled territory or from outside the country entirely , using another country \\'s transmission facilities . </Li> <Li> Numbers Stations . These stations regularly appear and disappear all over the shortwave radio band but are unlicensed and untraceable . It is believed that Numbers Stations are operated by government agencies and are used to communicate with clandestine operatives working within foreign countries . However , no definitive proof of such use has emerged . Because the vast majority of these broadcasts contain nothing but the recitation of blocks of numbers , in various languages , with occasional bursts of music , they have become known colloquially as `` Number Stations \\'\\' . Perhaps the most noted Number Station is the `` Lincolnshire Poacher \\'\\' , named after the 18th century English folk song , which is transmitted just before the sequences of numbers . </Li> <Li> Unlicensed two way radio activity by individuals such as taxi drivers , bus drivers and fishermen in various countries can be heard on various shortwave frequencies . Such unlicensed transmissions by `` pirate \\'\\' or `` bootleg \\'\\' two way radio operators can often cause signal interference to licensed stations . </Li> <Li> Pirate radio broadcasters who feature programming such as music , talk and other entertainment , can be heard sporadically and in various modes on the shortwave bands . </Li> <Li> Over-the - horizon radar : From 1976 to 1989 , the Soviet Union \\'s Russian Woodpecker over-the - horizon radar system blotted out numerous shortwave broadcasts daily . </Li> <Li> Ionospheric heaters used for scientific experimentation such as the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program in Alaska , and the Sura ionospheric heating facility in Russia . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Shortwave broadcasting ( edit ) </H2> <P> See International broadcasting for details on the history and practice of broadcasting to foreign audiences . </P> <P> See Shortwave relay station for the actual kinds of integrated technologies used to bring high power signals to listeners . </P> <H3> Frequency allocations ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Shortwave bands <P> The World Radiocommunication Conference ( WRC ) , organized under the auspices of the International Telecommunication Union , allocates bands for various services in conferences every few years .

This is done for practical reasons , or to attract attention in crowded bands ( 60m , 49m , 40m , 41m , 31m , 25m ) . </P> <P> The new digital audio broadcasting format for shortwave DRM operates 10 kHz or 20 kHz channels . There are some ongoing discussions with respect to specific band allocation for DRM , as it mainly transmitted in 10 kHz format . </P> <P> The power used by shortwave transmitters ranges from less than one watt for some experimental and amateur radio transmissions to 500 kilowatts and higher for intercontinental broadcasters and over-the - horizon radar . Shortwave transmitting centers often use specialized antenna designs ( like the ALLISS antenna technology ) to concentrate radio energy at the target area . </P> <H3> Advantages ( edit ) </H3> Soviet shortwave listener in Borisoglebsk , 1941 <P> Shortwave does possess a number of advantages over newer technologies , including the following : </P> <Ul> <Li> Difficulty of censoring programming by authorities in restrictive countries : unlike their relative ease in monitoring the Internet , government authorities face technical difficulties monitoring which stations ( sites ) are being listened to ( accessed ) . For example , during the attempted coup against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev , when his access to communications was limited ( e.g. his phones were cut off , etc . ) , Gorbachev was able to stay informed by means of the BBC World Service on shortwave . </Li> <Li> Low - cost shortwave radios are widely available in all but the most repressive countries in the world . Simple shortwave regenerative receivers can be easily built with a few parts . </Li> <Li> In many countries ( particularly in most developing nations and in the Eastern bloc during the Cold War era ) ownership of shortwave receivers has been and continues to be widespread ( in many of these countries some domestic stations also used shortwave ) . </Li> <Li> Many newer shortwave receivers are portable and can be battery - operated , making them useful in difficult circumstances . Newer technology includes hand - cranked radios which provide power without batteries . </Li> <Li> Shortwave radios can be used in situations where Internet or satellite communications service is temporarily or long - term unavailable ( or unaffordable ) . </Li> <Li> Shortwave radio travels much farther than broadcast FM ( 88 -- 108 MHz ) . Shortwave broadcasts can be easily transmitted over a distance of several thousands of kilometers , including from one continent to another . </Li> <Li> Particularly in tropical regions , SW is somewhat less prone to interference from thunderstorms than medium wave radio , and is able to cover a large geographic area with relatively low power ( and hence cost ) . Therefore , in many of these countries it is widely used for domestic broadcasting . </Li> <Li> Very little infrastructure is required for long - distance two - way communications using shortwave radio . All one needs is a pair of transceivers , each with an antenna , and a source of energy ( such as a battery , a portable generator , or the electrical grid ) . This makes shortwave radio one of the most robust means of communications , which can be disrupted only by interference or bad ionospheric conditions . Modern digital transmission modes such as MFSK and Olivia are even more robust , allowing successful reception of signals well below the noise floor of a conventional receiver . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Disadvantages ( edit ) </H3> <P> Shortwave radio \\'s benefits are sometimes regarded as being outweighed by its drawbacks , including : </P> <Ul> <Li> In most Western countries , shortwave radio ownership is usually limited to true enthusiasts , since most new standard radios do not receive the shortwave band . Therefore , Western audiences are limited . </Li> <Li> In the developed world , shortwave reception is very difficult in urban areas because of excessive noise from switched - mode power adapters , fluorescent or LED light sources , internet modems and routers , computers and many other sources of radio interference . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Shortwave listening ( edit ) </H2> A pennant sent to overseas listeners by Radio Budapest in the late 1980s Main article : Shortwave listening <P> The Asia - Pacific Telecommunity estimates that there are approximately 600 million shortwave broadcast - radio receivers in use in 2002 . WWCR claims that there are 1.5 billion shortwave receivers worldwide . </P> <P> Many hobbyists listen to shortwave broadcasters . In some cases , the goal is to hear as many stations from as many countries as possible ( DXing ) ; others listen to specialized shortwave utility , or `` ute \\'\\' , transmissions such as maritime , naval , aviation , or military signals . Others focus on intelligence signals from numbers stations , stations which transmit strange broadcast usually for intelligence operations , or the two way communications by amateur radio operators . Some short wave listeners behave analogously to `` lurkers \\'\\' on the Internet , in that they listen only and never make any attempt to send out their own signals . Other listeners participate in clubs , or actively send and receive QSL cards , or become involved with amateur radio and start transmitting on their own . </P> <P> Many listeners tune the shortwave bands for the programmes of stations broadcasting to a general audience ( such as Radio Taiwan International , China Radio International , Voice of America , Radio France Internationale , BBC World Service , Voice of Korea , Radio Free Sarawak etc . ) . Today , through the evolution of the Internet , the hobbyist can listen to shortwave signals via remotely controlled or web controlled shortwave receivers around the world , even without owning a shortwave radio . Many international broadcasters offer live streaming audio on their websites and a number have closed their shortwave service entirely , or severely curtailed it , in favour of internet transmission . </P> <P> Shortwave listeners , or SWLs , can obtain QSL cards from broadcasters , utility stations or amateur radio operators as trophies of the hobby . Some stations even give out special certificates , pennants , stickers and other tokens and promotional materials to shortwave listeners . </P> <H2> Shortwave broadcasts and music ( edit ) </H2> Composer Karlheinz Stockhausen <P> Some musicians have been attracted to the unique aural characteristics of shortwave radio which -- due to the nature of amplitude modulation , varying propagation conditions , and the presence of interference -- generally has lower fidelity than local broadcasts ( particularly via FM stations ) . Shortwave transmissions often have bursts of distortion , and `` hollow \\'\\' sounding loss of clarity at certain aural frequencies , altering the harmonics of natural sound and creating at times a strange `` spacey \\'\\' quality due to echoes and phase distortion . Evocations of shortwave reception distortions have been incorporated into rock and classical compositions , by means of delays or feedback loops , equalizers , or even playing shortwave radios as live instruments . Snippets of broadcasts have been mixed into electronic sound collages and live musical instruments , by means of analogue tape loops or digital samples . Sometimes the sounds of instruments and existing musical recordings are altered by remixing or equalizing , with various distortions added , to replicate the garbled effects of shortwave radio reception . </P> <P> The first attempts by serious composers to incorporate radio effects into music may be those of the Russian physicist and musician Léon Theremin , who perfected a form of radio oscillator as a musical instrument in 1928 ( regenerative circuits in radios of the time were prone to breaking into oscillation , adding various tonal harmonics to music and speech ) ; and in the same year , the development of a French instrument called the Ondes Martenot by its inventor Maurice Martenot , a French cellist and former wireless telegrapher . Karlheinz Stockhausen used shortwave radio and effects in works including Hymnen ( 1966 -- 67 ) , Kurzwellen ( 1968 ) -- adapted for the Beethoven Bicentennial in Opus 1970 with filtered and distorted snippets of Beethoven pieces -- Spiral ( 1968 ) , Pole , Expo ( both 1969 -- 70 ) , and Michaelion ( 1997 ) . </P> <P> Cypriot composer Yannis Kyriakides incorporated shortwave numbers station transmissions in his 1999 ConSPIracy cantata . </P> <P> Holger Czukay , a student of Stockhausen , was one of the first to use shortwave in a rock music context . In 1975 , German electronic music band Kraftwerk recorded a full length concept album around simulated radiowave and shortwave sounds , entitled Radio - Activity . The The \\'s Radio Cineola monthly broadcasts drew heavily on shortwave radio sound . </P> <H2> Shortwave \\'s future ( edit ) </H2> PC spectrum display of a modern software defined shortwave receiver Further information : Shortwave listening § Future of shortwave listening <P> The development of direct broadcasts from satellites has reduced the demand for shortwave receiver hardware , but there are still a great number of shortwave broadcasters . A new digital radio technology , Digital Radio Mondiale ( DRM ) , is expected to improve the quality of shortwave audio from very poor to standards comparable to the FM broadcast band . The future of shortwave radio is threatened by the rise of power line communication ( PLC ) , also known as Broadband over Power Lines ( BPL ) , which uses a data stream transmitted over unshielded power lines . As the BPL frequencies used overlap with shortwave bands , severe distortions can make listening to analog shortwave radio signals near power lines difficult or impossible . </P> <P> Experts disagree on the future of shortwave . According to Andy Sennitt , former editor of the World Radio TV Handbook , `` shortwave is a legacy technology , which is expensive and environmentally unfriendly . A few countries are hanging on to it , but most have faced up to the fact that the glory days of shortwave have gone . Religious broadcasters will still use it because they are not too concerned with listening figures \\'\\' . </P> <P> However Thomas Witherspoon , editor of shortwave news site SWLingPost.com wrote that `` shortwave remains the most accessible international communications medium that still provides listeners with the protection of complete anonymity \\'\\' . According to Nigel Fry , head of Distribution for the BBC World Service Group , `` I still see a place for shortwave in the 21st century , especially for reaching areas of the world that are prone to natural disasters that destroy local broadcasting and Internet infrastructure \\'\\' . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> ALLISS -- a very large rotatable antenna system used in international broadcasting </Li> <Li> Amateur radio -- also uses the shortwave bands , but with power levels under 2 kW </Li> <Li> International broadcasting </Li> <Li> List of American shortwave broadcasters </Li> <Li> List of shortwave radio broadcasters </Li> <Li> Long wave </Li> <Li> Medium wave </Li> <Li> Shortwave bands -- shortwave spectrum allocation </Li> <Li> shortwave relay station -- the fundamental way in which programmes are broadcast on shortwave </Li> <Li> SSB -- a method of radio signal modulation </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Grundig Satellit 400 international / professional ShortWaveRadio.ch </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Inconsistent article : itwissen.info : KW ( Kurzwelle ) SW ( short wave ) Quote : `` ...
